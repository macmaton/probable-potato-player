 *
 * One or more notes may be played simultaneously in a chord. In abc, a chord is denoted by a group of notes between
 * square brackets ( [ and ] ):
 *  [CEG]
 * Notes within a chord may be embellished with an accidental or a multiplicative factor.
 * If the notes in a chord have different durations, the duration of the chord is determined by the duration of the
 * first note specified in the chord. For example, in [C2E4]G2 , there would first be an E note and a C note playing together, and then an E note and a G note playing together.
 *
 * A chord may not contain any rests or tuplets.
 *
 * The chord forms a syntactic grouping, to which the same prefixes and postfixes can be attached as to an ordinary
 * note (except for accidentals which should be attached to individual notes within the chord and decorations which
 * may be attached to individual notes within the chord.  When both inside and outside the chord length modifiers are
 * used, they should be multiplied. Example: [C2E2G2]3 has the same meaning as [CEG]6.
